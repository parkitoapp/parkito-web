# Redirects for old URL structure to new structure

# Old: /myCity -> New: /citta/myCity

# Old: /myCity/myParkingAddress -> New: /citta/myCity/myParkingAddress

#

# These redirects handle old indexed URLs from search engines.

# Note: Next.js routes (like /blog, /contatti, /citta, etc.) will be handled by Next.js first,

# so these redirects only apply to routes that would otherwise 404.
